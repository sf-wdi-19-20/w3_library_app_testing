#Library App Testing
- Step 1: Install all npm modules for this project with `npm install`.
- Step 2: Create a `test` folder with a file inside called library_spec.js.
- Step 3: Open up library.js and try to figure out what the functions are doing.
- Step 4: Think of how we could write tests to ensure that this functionality is correct.
- Step 5: Write the tests in library_spec.js.
- Step 6: There is one test that *should* fail. Can you correct the code to make it pass?
